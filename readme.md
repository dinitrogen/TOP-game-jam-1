# Melody Quest

Melody Quest is a music education/arcade action game with an 8-bit retro style, offering a fun and engaging approach to help students with memorization of musical note placement on the staff and basic musical theory concepts.  Players will explore the depths of a mysterious dungeon, navigating 50+ maze-like levels, dodging enemies, and facing-off against a variety of bosses while collecting notes on a quest to recover the "Pentatonic," a magical relic that provides the source of all music in the world. 

Melody Quest features original pixel art and an original 8-bit-inspired soundtrack of 12+ tracks. The game also features a scoring system that rewards flawless playing with score multiplier bonuses, encouraging replay for high score attempts.

Melody Quest was developed by a small team for the first game jam hosted by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The game was programmed all with JavaScript/HTML/CSS, no fancy frameworks or libraries.

### Instructions

Navigate the main character through each floor of the dungeon before time expires. Select the corresponding letter of the music note displayed on the musical staff to progress. You will lose a life if you select a wrong note, or get hit by an enemy. Useful items will sometimes appear to help you on your adventure. Playing well will increase the score multiplier and maximize your score!

An easy mode is also availble which eliminates the timer and enables a hint system.
